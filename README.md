# Z3 in Phaser

- This is a demonstration of Z3 SMT solving used in the Phaser game engine. It was built using [z3-web-browser](https://github.com/collectioncard/z3-web-browser) by Thomas Wessel as starter code, in order to display Z3's output in a web browser using Vite.
- Example Phaser world used is [Pathfinder](https://github.com/JimWhiteheadUCSC/Pathfinder) by Jim Whitehead.
- Assets by Kenney [Tiny Dungeon](https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-dungeon) and [Tiny Town](https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-town).
